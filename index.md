## Welcome
I'm Ching-Kung Lin and I'm a Software Engineer. 
I am currently majoring in Computer Science at CUNY of Queens College. I am in my Senior year now. So far I've known many CS-related skills from the courses such as Oracle, Html, CSS, JavaScript, iOS Design, AWS, Azure and C++. I've also learned Python by myself due to my strong interest in the programming field.
Check my resume to know more about me.
